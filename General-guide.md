This guide will help you understand and use the benchmark tool found in [https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool).  
It will teach you about the xml configuration file, how to use that file to generate benchmarks and lastly, how to run and evaluate those benchmarks.  
  

# XML Runscript  

Understanding the runscript is the most important part of using the benchmark tool. It controls every aspect of the process. So, it is very important to know how the various components relate to each other and how they form the end benchmark.  
  

## Example Runscript  

In the next few sections, I will explain how the example file [runscript-example.xml](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool/blob/master/runscripts/runscript-example.xml) works and how to adapt this to your purposes.  
  

### Folder structure  

When running the runscript (we will see how later) a folder structure is created. The name of the first folder in the tree is given by the first line in the script:  
```
<runscript output="output-folder">
```  
In this case, the name of the folder is "output-folder". It is recommended that the name should be changed to something meaningful and representative of the benchmark you are running.  
  

The name of the second folder is given by the project name which is explained later.  
  

The third folder in the structure is given by the information in line 3:  

```
<machine name="zuse" cpu="24x8xE5520@2.27GHz" memory="24GB"/>
```

The values of *cpu* and *memory* are irrelevant for the naming. In this case, the third folder is named "zuse".  
  

After this, the folders are named based on the structure of the benchmark instances and the instance names.  
  

### Configuration  

Line 5 is where we first start setting up how the benchmarks will run:  

```  
<config name="seq-generic" template="templates/seq-generic.sh"/>  
```  

This line states how a **configuration** will run. The *name* is just an ID that we can reference later. The value on *template* refers to a template file that shows how to run each instance and configuration.  
  

### The run template  
  

Taking a look at [templates/seq-generic.sh](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool/blob/master/templates/seq-generic.sh) it can seem complicated. The first relevant line, line 4, is just a bash script that will uncompress your instance file if it is compressed. If the file is just a regular text file it will just print the text to the standard output.  
The next relevant line, line 10, is where we run the instance with clingo. The first part of the line ```[[ -e .finished ]]``` just checks to see if a .finished file exists. If it exists, the script is done executing. If it doesn't exist, it proceeds with running the instance.  

```  
$CAT "{run.file}" | "{run.root}/programs/runsolver-3.3.4" \  
-M 20000 \  
-w runsolver.watcher \  
-o runsolver.solver \  
-W {run.timeout} \  
"{run.root}/programs/{run.solver}" {run.args}  
```  

```{run.file}```refers to the name of the instance.  
```{run.root}``` is the path of the benchmark-tool folder  
```{run.timeout}``` is the walltime for this run  
```{run.solver}``` is the solver to be used for this run  
```{run.args}``` are the arguments to be used by the solver  
  

The script has a default memory limit of 20 000 MB which can be changed by modifying the value of the ```-M``` argument.  
If you don't have the specific runsolver used in the script, you can simply change its name to match the one you have. As can be seen from the file the runsolver is expected to be in the programs folder of the benchmark-tool folder.  

Small tip: If your instances have an "#include" directive they may not work unless they have **absolute** paths. An easy fix for this is to not pipe the text of the instance and instead put the instance as a regular argument to the solver:  

```  
"{run.root}/programs/runsolver-3.3.4" \  
-M 20000 \  
-w runsolver.watcher \  
-o runsolver.solver \  
-W {run.timeout} \  
"{run.root}/programs/{run.solver}" {run.file} {run.args}  
```  
  

Another fix is to change the instances so that they do not contain those "#include" directives. This is, however, not always possible or the best course of action.  

### Run settings  

The run settings are given in the example from line 7 to line 11. line 7 starts describing how the *system* looks like. 

```
<system name="clingo" version="4.5.4" measures="clasp" config="seq-generic">
```

The values of *name* and *version* work together to describe the name of a **bash script** named **{name}-{version}** and is found in the **programs** folder of the benchmark-tool. So, in the case of the example, the solver given to the template file described in the configuration is *programs/clingo-4.5.4*. Since this is a regular bash script you can put whatever you want in here.  
  

The value in *measures* describes how the results will be evaluated once the benchmark is done and you have the results. This value has absolutely no effect on the bash script. We will go into detail on this later on.
  

The value of *config* refers to which configuration should be used to run this solver. This is where the value of *name* in line 5 comes into play.

### Run arguments  

The arguments that are going to be used by clingo are given in line 9.  

```
<setting name="setting-1" cmdline="'--stats --quiet=1,0'" tag="basic" />
```  

The value of *name* is an identifier for the arguments given in *cmdline* and will appear as the name of this configuration when evaluating the results. The value of *cmdline* can be any valid string that can be given to the solver you are using. Finally, the value of *tag* is also an identifier for this configuration but only within this runscript.  
  

If you are looking to run more than one configuration, you can just copy and paste the line and edit the values as necessary. Make sure that the new settings are **above** the closing ```</system>```. Keep in mind that *name* has to be unique *name*, values of tag can be the same and should be the same for configurations that are meant to be run in the same group. 

Finally, there is an additional argument that is not present in the example, *pbstemplate*. The default value for this argument is "templates/single.pbs" which can be found [here](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool/blob/master/templates/single.pbs) and is only relevant for pbsjobs(described below). 

This template is used when we want to group calls to instances into one job. In short, this template describes how a single job will look like. This includes setting up the walltime for the job, how the environment is (for example, if we want to load a virtual/conda env or anything else) and in which order the instances will be run.

Looking at the file, the first few lines are self explanatory. They set the various values relating to SLURM. The lines 14 onwards are just the calls to the scripts that run the instances. The most important line is line 12. This is where we should set up the important environment where the instances should run. For example, activating the environment that has clingo installed. I recommend to do this explicitly in this file instead of sourcing a .bashrc file.

A very important line that should always be included is 

```
source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
```

Adding this line lets you load modules found in the cluster such as anaconda or gcc.

### Defining Jobs  

A job is basically where you set the parameters on how long a single clingo run should last and how long all runs should last. In the example file, this is defined in two places, line 13 and 15. We will start with line 13.  
  

```  
<seqjob name="seq-gen" timeout="900" runs="1" script_mode="timeout" walltime="50:00:00" parallel="1"/>  
```  

The benchmark tool can generate two types of jobs. Seqjobs that are meant to be run on a regular machine and pbsjobs that are meant to be run on a machine with SLURM. Line 13 defines a seqjob, as seen at the beginning of the line. As usual, it has a *name* which is an identifier for this particular job. *timeout* is the maximum amount of time in seconds a single run can take, *runs* is how many runs will be done for each instance. *walltime* is the maximum amount of time that running all instances can take (format is HH:MM:SS).  
  

Line 15 defines a pbsjob:  

```  
<pbsjob name="pbs-gen" timeout="1200" runs="1" script_mode="timeout" walltime="23:59:59" cpt="4"/>  
```  

Most values are the same as with seqjobs. *cpt* defines how many cores can be used per run. *cpt* stands for "cores per task".  
  

For pbsjobs, there is an interaction between *timeout* and *walltime*. When creating the benchmarks, the walltime will always be respected. So, if its not possible to run all instances sequentially inside the walltime specified, they will be split into as many jobs as necessary so that the walltime is never surpassed. For example, if the walltime is 25 hours and you have 100 instances with a timeout of 1 hour each, there will be 4 jobs, each with 25 instances which will be run in parallel.  
  

This pbsjob example does not include the *partition* argument. Its value is the name of the partition that will be used when running the jobs in the SLURM machine. The default value for it is "kr". Other values for this argument can be "short" and "long". If short is used the walltime can not exceed 24 hours.

As a final note, despite having "pbsjob" and "seqjob" both use the same seq-generic.sh file.

### Benchmarks - Instance location  

Lines 17 to 19 indicate where the instances are located. The value in *name* is the same as usual. The value of *path* is, of course, the path of the folder containing the instances. The folder is recursively searched. If there are several folders with instances, the folder where the instances are located is taken as a "domain" and there will be an additional separation of the results using these "domains".  
If there are folders that should not be included in the benchmark instances, the ignore tag can be used to define a *prefix* which will be ignored.  
  

### Projects  

Projects are where all of the above elements come together to define a complete benchmark. We will focus on the project defined in lines 25 to 27:  

```  
<project name="clingo-pbs-job" job="pbs-gen">  
<runtag machine="zuse" benchmark="no-pigeons" tag="basic"/>  
</project>  
```  

Previously, all of the components from before were independent of each other. When defining a project we pick the components we want to form the benchmark. The values of *job*, *machine*, *benchmark* and *tag* refers to previously defined components. The *tag* refers to all settings that have that same tag. There is also a special value that *tag* can take, \*all\*, that refers to all settings. The value of *name* is what gives the name of the second folder in the folder structure reference before.
  

The project in lines 21 to 23 is defined in the same manner. The only difference is that it will use a seqjob instead of a pbsjob.  
  

## Running the script  

Running the script is very simple. Simply go to the benchmark-tool folder and run:  

```  
$ ./bgen path/to/runscript.xml  
```  

where runscript.xml is the runscript that you want to use. This will create a folder structure using the values given in the script. To start running the benchmark, navigate 3 folders down to the folder with the name of the machine. There should be either a python or bash file named "start" with the appropriate extension. Execute this file to run the benchmarks.  
  
  

## Evaluating  

Once the benchmarks have finished running it is time to evaluate. To evaluate, we have to do 2 things. First, we have to retrieve the results and save them into an xml file. This is done with the "beval" bash script:  

```  
$ ./beval path/to/runscript.xml > benchmark-evaluated.xml  
```  

The script writes the results with an xml format to the standard output. We save this output into a file with a name that you choose.  

Now is the time to go back to the "Run settings" section where the value of *measures* is given. This value will refer to a python file with the same name(with the .py extension) located in the src/benchmarktool/resultparser folder. In this file a function with the same name is defined that returns the parsed statistics of the run when the ./beval script is called.

The value in the example is "clasp". This means that we use the file [clasp.py](https://github.com/potassco/benchmark-tool/blob/master/src/benchmarktool/resultparser/clasp.py) to evaluate the results.  
Which values can be given to the -m option used in the next script also depend on what values the file can process. In this case, the values are:  

```  
time, models, choices, conflicts, restarts, optimum, interrupted, error, memerror  
```

Once we have the evaluated benchmarks we can convert them into a formatted csv file. We do this with the "bconv" script:  

```  
$ ./bconv -m time:t benchmark-evaluated.xml > results.ods
```  

The run time will now be found in a csv named results.ods. The -m option also takes multiple values. The format is a comma-separated list of measures of form name[:{t,to,-}] to include in the table (optional argument determines coloring).

### Quick tips

#### Things to make sure are done
This is a list of things to keep in mind when starting to run the benchmarks.

Make sure that:
* the runsolver in the seq-generic.sh file has the correct name
* the single.pbs file loads the correct environment
* the bash script is executable
* the benchmark folder is correct and is ideally an absolute path
* the cmdline in settings contain the "--stats" argument

#### Inspecting for errors
A quick way to inspect the benchmarks for errors once they are done is to use a find command to search for the clingo/runsolver output files and then parse each file for some error message.
```
$ find myfolder -name runsolver.solver | xargs grep "error message" -i
$ find myfolder -name runsolver.watcher | xargs grep "error message" -i
```
